## Conway's game of life has 4 Rules:
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by under population.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.


## In the browser (developer console):
For control you can set the delay (in ms) between updates with `delay = 10`  
For manual control: `automatic = false` and then press the `r` button to run
